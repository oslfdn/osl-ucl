                      OPEN SOURCE LIFE — UNIVERSAL COPYLEFT LICENSE
                                   (OSL-UCL) VERSION 2.5.0
                                  OFFICIAL LICENSE TEXT (TXT)
===============================================================================


PREAMBLE
--------

The Open Source Life – Universal Copyleft License (“OSL-UCL” or “License”) is a
perpetual, irrevocable, international legal instrument designed to ensure
maximal user freedom, mandatory transparency, and durable openness of all
Derivative Works across all present and future technological environments.

This License shall be interpreted purposively to:

  (a) preserve user rights;
  (b) prevent technological, contractual, or legal circumvention;
  (c) maintain the commons created under it;
  (d) apply across all jurisdictions; and
  (e) bind all entities, including non-human or computational agents.

Where ambiguity exists, the interpretation most protective of user freedom and
most restrictive against enclosure shall prevail.



===============================================================================
ARTICLE 1 — DEFINITIONS
===============================================================================

1.1  “Work” means the creation licensed under this License, including technical,
     functional, scientific, artistic, cultural, and engineering material.

1.2  “Source Form” means the preferred, fully editable, human-readable form of
     the Work.

1.3  “Object Form” means any non-source, compiled, fabricated, or executable
     form of the Work.

1.4  “Derivative Work” means any work that modifies, adapts, extends,
     integrates, translates, transforms, reimplements, or otherwise incorporates
     the Work, directly or indirectly.

1.5  “Distribution” means making the Work or a Derivative Work available to any
     third party by any means.

1.6  “Technical Restriction Mechanism” (TRM) means any mechanism that restricts
     inspection, modification, execution, or interoperability, including DRM,
     TPMs, HSMs, enclaves, secure elements, attestation systems, fuse-locking,
     vendor-controlled signatures, remote execution gating, or cloud-controlled
     integrity models.

1.7  “Closed System” means any system that does not permit full user inspection,
     modification, replacement, or analysis.

1.8  “AI System” means any system trained, refined, evaluated, or influenced
     using the Work, directly or indirectly.

1.9  “User” means any individual, entity, or computational agent exercising
     rights under this License.

1.10 “Root of Trust” means any key, credential, or component on which system
     integrity or authentication depends.

1.11 “Aggregation” means the side-by-side inclusion of independent works that
     are not combined, linked, or integrated into a single functional work.

1.12 “Linking” means static or dynamic linking, runtime linking, IPC-level
     integration, ABI-level coupling, or hardware co-packaging in a manner
     where the Work and another work form an integrated or interdependent whole.



===============================================================================
ARTICLE 2 — CONTRIBUTOR REPRESENTATIONS
===============================================================================

2.1  By contributing to the Work, each contributor affirms that:

      (a) they have the legal right to contribute the material;
      (b) the contribution does not violate third-party rights;
      (c) no trade secret, NDA, or employment restriction is being breached; and
      (d) they grant all rights required under this License.

2.2  Contributions are merged under this License automatically.



===============================================================================
ARTICLE 3 — GRANT OF RIGHTS
===============================================================================

Subject to compliance with this License, the User receives a perpetual,
worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

  (b) study, inspect, reproduce, and reverse-engineer the Work;
  (c) modify, adapt, and create Derivative Works;
  (d) distribute the Work or any Derivative Work; and
  (e) integrate or embed the Work into any system, subject to Article 4.

All rights not expressly granted are withheld.



===============================================================================
ARTICLE 4 — RECIPROCITY (COPYLEFT) & LINKING
===============================================================================

4.1  All Derivative Works must be licensed solely under this License.

4.2  Aggregation does not create a Derivative Work.

4.3  Any form of Linking—including static, dynamic, runtime, or ABI-integrated
     linking—creates a Derivative Work and triggers all obligations herein.

4.4  IPC, message passing, or coprocessor integration that depends on the Work
     for core functionality constitutes Linking.

4.5  No additional terms, restrictions, or conditions may be imposed.

4.6  Conflicting provisions in NDAs, EULAs, ToS, or similar agreements are void.



===============================================================================
ARTICLE 5 — SOURCE FORM OBLIGATION
===============================================================================

5.1  Distribution requires complete, corresponding Source Form in a fully
     editable, unencrypted, unobfuscated, and openly documented format.

5.2  Build scripts, toolchains, compiler flags, and all required components
     must be included.

5.3  Intentional obfuscation in compilation or packaging is prohibited.

5.4  Partial disclosure constitutes a violation.

ARTICLE 6 — PATENTS
===============================================================================

6.1  Contributors grant a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free patent license
     covering all rights necessary to use, modify, and distribute the Work and
     all Derivative Works.

20.1  Works originally licensed under permissive licenses that impose only
      attribution and notice obligations — including but not limited to the
      MIT License, BSD 2-Clause, BSD 3-Clause, and ISC License — may be
      incorporated into a Work or Derivative Work licensed under OSL-UCL,
      provided that all required notices are preserved in the attribution
      section defined in Article XIV.

20.2  Works licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, may be incorporated
      into OSL-UCL-licensed projects, provided that:

        (a) all copyright, license, and NOTICE file contents are preserved
            and included under Article XIV;
        (b) no Apache-specific obligations are imposed on downstream users;
        (c) any Apache patent licensing clauses are satisfied upstream.

20.3  Incorporation of material under this Article does not modify or waive the
      requirement in Article IV that all resulting Derivative Works be
      licensed solely under OSL-UCL.

20.4  This Article does not permit incorporation of material under licenses
      that:

        (a) require continued license propagation (e.g. GPL, LGPL, AGPL);
        (b) impose additional copyleft obligations or contractual terms;
        (c) include field-of-use limitations or non-commercial restrictions;
        (d) conflict with the exclusive licensing requirement of Article IV.
